# Contributing to api-list

> Basically the whole point is to create a central repository for all the API's list known to us. 
>
> So we don't need to scratch our heads when we need the api.

## Instructions
The steps to add the api to the list pretty basic.
1. Check whether the API you are planning to add doesn't exists in the list already. (Obviously ðŸ™„)
2. Make sure you have forked the repository so you can contribute.
3. Create a branch having the API's name. For example if you are adding a Google Maps Api. 
Then create a branch named "google-maps".
4. To make the structure better we store the api in different folders according to their category.
Example Google Maps fall under "maps" category. So we will create a folder named google-maps under maps folder.
Note : If you are adding a API of a category that doesn't exists. Then you must create a folder for that category first.
5. Provide the snippet or description of that API inside the folder you created in the previous step. Also provide a README.md in the api's folder, that has a description about the api.
6. Once the snippet of code is added. Now you need to add the api to the list of its category in the main README[README.md] file.
Note : If you have added a new category. Then you need to add the category in the list a create a section that category in README[README.md].
7. After completing all the steps , it's time to make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)!

Once youâ€™ve submitted a pull request, the collaborators can review your proposed changes and decide whether or not to incorporate (pull in) your changes.

Thats it. Once your changes are accepted your api will be added the main list.
